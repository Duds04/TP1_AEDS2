using
an
analog
netlist
generation
tool
to
evaluate
a
mixed
circuit
verification
framework
the
growing
demand
for
powerful
integrated
circuits
in
terms
of
power
consumption
and
processing
creates
a
big
obstacle
for
hardware
verification
engineers
to
ensure
integrated
circuit
ic
quality
actually
ic
verification
consumes
more
than
half
of
the
development
cycle
and
with
the
growing
complexity
the
verification
also
increases
when
we
consider
analog
blocks
in
mixedsignal
ics
we
have
an
even
more
challenging
verification
process
unfortunately
the
environments
for
mixedsignal
verification
are
inefficient
because
it
is
not
possible
to
generate
realistic
analog
outputs
to
the
digital
blocks
inputs
during
simulation
this
work
evaluates
alias
a
tool
that
generates
digital
abstractions
of
analog
circuits
for
verification
to
evaluate
alias
efficiency
we
have
created
an
adc
and
dac
netlist
tool
generator
to
perform
verification
in
different
mixedsignal
scenarios
and
circuit
configurations
