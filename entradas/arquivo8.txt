educational
games
are
an
attractive
way
of
teaching
between
most
of
the
young
students
of
high
school
or
college
although
itâ€™s
still
not
much
explored
by
the
teachers
of
schools
orand
universities
many
times
those
students
fails
in
finishing
their
course
by
lack
of
interest
in
classes
specially
in
the
area
of
exact
sciences
since
most
of
them
consider
such
disciplines
difficult
therefore
this
work
presents
the
development
analysis
and
tests
of
the
game
draw
the
function
an
educational
game
for
teaching
in
the
area
of
exact
sciences
specifically
mathematical
functions
during
the
tests
we
observed
that
draw
the
function
has
a
pedagogical
capacity
helping
in
the
teaching
of
mathematical
functions
as
well
as
being
an
attractive
and
motivating
game
for
its
players
