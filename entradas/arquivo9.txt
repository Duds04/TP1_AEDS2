the
great
advances
achieved
in
very
large
scale
integrated
technology
cause
an
increase
in
the
difficulty
for
routing
the
buses
through
the
spacing
while
minimizing
the
cost
the
term
bus
defines
a
communication
system
that
connects
internal
components
in
an
integrated
circuit
the
routing
process
consists
in
placing
the
wires
from
the
bus
on
space
there
are
some
rules
related
to
wire
width
the
spacing
between
obstacles
routing
direction
and
others
we
need
to
respect
the
routing
process
can
be
separated
in
global
routing
and
detailed
routing
this
paper
presents
a
solution
passing
in
both
processes
in
the
global
routing
we
use
a
differential
evolution
based
approach
in
a
graph
representation
of
the
area
to
find
a
brute
path
of
minimum
length
to
guide
the
following
step
by
the
next
we
use
a
greedy
selection
to
place
the
wires
on
the
tracks
we
compare
the
results
achieved
using
a
classic
flux
algorithm
and
three
