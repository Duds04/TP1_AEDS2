problem
with
uncertainties
the
economic
load
dispatch
problem
has
been
formulated
as
the
minimization
of
total
fuel
cost
needed
to
generate
electricity
in
power
plants
due
to
the
environmental
issues
that
arise
from
the
emissions
of
polluting
gases
produced
by
fossilfueled
electric
power
plants
it
becomes
the
environmentaleconomic
dispatch
eed
multiobjective
optimization
problem
eed
problems
have
been
most
commonly
solved
using
deterministic
models
without
considering
uncertainties
in
this
context
a
robust
model
to
cope
with
uncertainties
is
necessary
because
the
deterministic
model
is
not
able
to
reflect
some
real
condition
in
practical
applications
since
fuel
cost
and
emission
coefficients
may
be
subjected
to
inaccuracies
for
instance
in
this
paper
both
deterministic
and
robust
eed
problem
models
are
first
formulated
and
the
robust
evolutionary
optimization
algorithm
reoa
is
proposed
for
the
robust
model
the
worst
case
scenario
is
estimated
to
find
reliable
solutions
that
still
feasible
and
have
a
good
performance
under
the
action
of
parametric
uncertainties
comparative
studies
are
carried
out
to
examine
the
effectiveness
of
the
proposed
approach
simulation
results
are
presented
for
the
standard
ieee
30bus
system
the
obtained
results
are
satisfactory
compared
to
the
best
solutions
found
in
the
literature
