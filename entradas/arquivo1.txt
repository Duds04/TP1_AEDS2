realworld
problems
many
times
are
characterized
by
being
composed
by
multiple
interdependent
components
in
this
case
benchmark
problems
that
do
not
represent
that
interdependency
are
not
a
good
choice
to
assess
algorithms
performance
recently
in
the
literature
a
benchmark
problem
called
travelling
thief
problem
was
proposed
to
better
represent
realworld
multicomponent
problems
ttp
is
a
combination
of
two
wellknown
problems
01
knapsack
problem
kp
and
the
travelling
salesman
problem
tsp
this
paper
presents
a
genetic
algorithmbased
optimization
approach
called
multicomponent
genetic
algorithm
mcga
for
solving
ttp
the
ideia
is
solve
the
overall
problem
instead
of
each
subcomponent
separately
starting
from
solution
for
the
tsp
component
obtained
by
the
chained
linkernighan
heuristic
the
mcga
applies
the
evolutionary
process
evaluation
selection
crossover
and
mutation
iteratively
using
different
operators
for
kp
and
tsp
components
the
mcga
was
tested
on
some
representative
instances
of
ttp
available
in
the
literature
the
comparisons
show
that
mcga
obtains
competitive
solutions
for
ttp
instances
with
a
number
of
cities
between
51
and
