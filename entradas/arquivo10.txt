toward
nanometric
scale
integration
an
automatic
routing
approach
for
nml
circuits
in
the
recent
years
many
technologies
have
been
studied
in
order
to
take
place
as
a
replacement
or
complement
to
cmos
these
emerging
technologies
known
as
field
coupled
nanotechnologies
seek
to
operate
at
nanometric
scales
and
overcome
the
problems
that
are
hard
or
impossible
to
be
addressed
by
cmos
technology
however
these
new
technologies
introduce
the
need
of
developing
tools
to
perform
circuit
mapping
placement
and
routing
nanomagnetic
logic
circuit
nml
is
one
of
these
emergent
technologies
it
relies
on
the
polarization
of
nanomagnets
to
perform
operations
through
majority
logic
in
this
work
we
propose
an
approach
to
automatically
map
a
gatelevel
circuit
to
a
nml
layout
we
use
the
breadth
first
search
to
perform
the
placement
and
the
a
algorithm
to
transverse
the
circuit
and
build
the
routes
for
each
node
to
evaluate
the
effectiveness
of
our
approach
we
use
a
series
of
iscasâ€™85
benchmarks
our
results
show
an
area
reduction
varying
from
20
to
60
