atomic
silicon
quantum
dot
sqd
is
a
prominent
alternative
to
the
current
complementary
metal
oxide
semiconductor
cmos
transistor
due
to
the
low
energy
consumption
and
high
integration
potential
this
emerging
technology
applies
silicon
dangling
bonds
dbs
that
behave
similarly
to
quantumdots
moreover
it
does
not
require
cryogenic
temperatures
unlike
other
quantumdotbased
approaches
this
paper
proposes
two
novel
3input
gates
orand
and
andor
hence
we
compare
these
3input
designs
with
the
equivalent
circuits
composed
of
2input
gates
we
use
the
stateoftheart
simulator
named
siqad
to
design
and
validate
our
experiments
our
main
contribution
is
the
novel
3input
gate
designs
that
provide
area
and
energy
reductions
we
achieve
an
average
of
53
energy
savings
for
all
3input
gates
compared
to
the
equivalent
circuit
built
with
2input
gates
