virtualization
of
a
reconfigurable
architecture
on
the
intel
harp
platform
researches
in
heterogeneous
computing
have
shown
that
the
usage
of
more
than
one
computational
node
in
the
same
system
increases
the
performance
and
decreases
the
energy
consumption
there
are
some
types
of
architectures
that
have
many
advantages
both
in
performance
increasing
and
in
energy
efficiency
such
as
architectures
that
possess
a
fpga
as
an
accelerating
unit
an
example
of
this
type
of
architecture
is
the
harp
recently
launched
by
intel
currently
in
order
to
use
the
harp’s
fpga
the
developer
must
implement
an
accelerating
functional
unit
afu
and
perform
the
synthesis
of
this
unity
in
the
fpga
but
this
synthesis
may
demand
a
considerable
time
making
the
architecure
unfeasible
for
a
real
time
system
that
requires
the
fpga
reconfiguration
thus
in
this
work
it
is
presented
an
abstract
layer
for
the
harp’s
fpga
which
allows
the
fpga
reconfiguration
with
no
need
to
perform
a
new
synthesis
making
this
architecture
feasible
for
a
real
time
system
