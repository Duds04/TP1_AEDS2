a
hardware
accelerator
implementation
for
realtime
collision
detection
collision
detection
algorithms
are
used
to
detect
when
virtual
objects
collide
and
the
results
of
these
collisions
this
type
of
algorithm
is
used
by
many
research
areas
such
as
simulation
automatic
path
finding
tolerance
checking
among
others
this
type
of
algorithm
is
processed
in
realtime
intel
created
the
harp
platform
which
uses
a
pci
with
8gbs
bandwidth
this
decreased
the
memory
latency
allowing
realtime
processing
of
fine
grain
applications
such
as
collision
detection
algorithms
in
this
paper
we
propose
a
heterogeneous
system
in
order
to
use
the
fpga
on
the
harp
as
an
accelerator
for
collision
detection
algorithms
our
results
show
a
speedup
of
145
in
execution
time
