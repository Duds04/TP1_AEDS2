a
mesh
sensor
network
based
on
bluetooth
comparing
topologies
to
crop
monitoring
the
growth
of
the
world
population
increases
the
demand
for
food
and
other
products
from
agriculture
therefore
it
is
increasingly
needed
to
enhance
and
optimize
the
productivity
of
farms
through
using
a
wireless
sensor
network
wsn
and
the
application
of
the
internet
of
things
iot
technologies
we
can
better
monitor
the
condition
of
farm
crops
in
this
work
we
designed
a
bluetooth
low
energy
mesh
network
joined
fluorescence
sensors
for
agricultural
crop
monitoring
and
also
we
evaluated
the
suitability
of
this
solution
in
a
crop
field
scenario
